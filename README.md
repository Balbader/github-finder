# Github Finder

React app to search Github profiles. This app uses the Context API along with the useContext and useReducer hooks for state management.<br>
The goal of this project was to get better at refactoring the code base from<br>`React Class Components` to `React Hooks`<br>
Check the app here: https://basilgithubfinder.netlify.app/ <br><br>

`npm start`<br><br>
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open http://localhost:3000 <br><br>
`npm run build`<br><br>
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
