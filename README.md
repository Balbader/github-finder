# Github Finder

React app to search Github profiles. This app uses the Context API along with the useContext and useReducer hooks for state management and is part of the "Modern React Front To Back" Udemy course.<br>
The goal of this project was to get better at refactoring the code base from `React Class Components` to `React Hooks`

## Usage

`npm install`<br><br>
`npm start`<br><br>
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open http://localhost:3000 <br><br>
`npm run build`<br><br>
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
Props to @bradtraversy for the awesome tutorial.
